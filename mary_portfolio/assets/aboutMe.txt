In summary:
I was born in 2000 march 17th.
I love cats and bikes. This is a picture of me in one of my favorite tour with my biking group. Our group name is CHARTIRA.
In addition to these things, I love computer and everything about it, solving problems, codes, thinking about how to make our lives easier
and avoid doing boring tasks and more than everything i love data science. I think i am able to analyze data and it is so much fun to me to do it.

In the end, I hope you could know me just a bit better with this information that i provided.
best regards.
