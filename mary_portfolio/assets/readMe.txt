In this project I used gRPC as the API method. it is google's rpc. It was challenging as it was my first time using other methods 
instead of restful API.
For state managament I used provider package and since we needed to monitor the status of the miners in real time it was a good choice
for the project.
Username, password and a working IP is needed to log into app and use its functionality, but since all miners are turned off
it is not posiible now. Hence, i uploaded the story board so you can get the gist of the app and how it looks like.
